## A Custom Visual Novel Engine For Non-Programmers
My goal with this engine is to make it easy for Non-Programmers to create visual novels, similar to something like renpy

*But without ANY coding*


I wish to achieve this through a custom scripting language that resembles, well a script. I know I just said no programming and this is technically programming, but you get what im trying to say... (right?)

THIS PROJECT IS BAREBONES AT THE MOMENT (0.0.0.0.1v)


## Usage/Examples

```text
*enter Saber saber
So, what am I doing here exactly?
*setsprite Saber angry_1
Hurry up and say something!
```

## TODO:
- Proper command handelling 
- Proper sprite class and sprite ownership
- Solid engine foundation
- Delay between commands
- Proper command advancement
- Actual choices like a proper visual novel
- Animations (sprite and background)
- Menus (Main, Pause, Settings etc)
